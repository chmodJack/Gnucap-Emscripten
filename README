Readme for development snapshot 2013-04-23

This is a development snapshot.  As such, there may be problems due to
new work.

This snapshot splits the code into sections "lib", "apps", "main".

"main" is a simple main program "gnucap" that dynamically links to
libgnucap.

"lib" is the core library "libgnucap.so", required for all programs in
the gnucap collection.  This library can also be used with different
front-ends, possibly in other languages.

"apps" is a set of plugins that are loaded by default.  It builds
"libgnucap-default-plugins.so".  The ".cc" files here are mostly
independent of each other.  To add or remove one of them from the
build, just edit "Make1" and recompile.  Alternatively, any of them
can be extracted and built separately.

"modelgen" is the old model compiler, which now links to libgnucap.so.


EMSCRIPTEN COMPILE
-----

 ./configure
 make
 make javascript
 
First the make script will compile the binary using g++. This is necessary because the binary build the models that are needed for emscripten. Next the makefile runs Makeem++. Makeeem++ contains the javascript build configuration.

The result is 4MB and it seems like it will run in nodejs but I am currently having trouble getting it to run in Webtronix. This is probably because of a difference in Emscripten versions. If you don't need some of the models in the apps directory just delete the name from the list of filenames.
